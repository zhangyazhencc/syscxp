            Policy has two states: Enabled and Disabled.
            Enabled means resources in this Policy is avaiable to manipulate where Disabled means no operation can be applied.
            currently, Policy state won't effect any API, they are reserved for future.
            state changing of Policy will cascade to its sub-resources: cluster and host. for example, disable a Policy will disable
            all clusters and hosts which belong to this Policy. However, if any sub-resources in the situation that its state cannot be
            changed, ancestral state changing of Policy will fail
